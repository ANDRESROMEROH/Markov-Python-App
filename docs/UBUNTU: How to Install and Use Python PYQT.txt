From the CLI we'll need to run the following 2 commands in order to install PyQT version 4 and the GUIs designer:

sudo apt-get install python-qt4

For the QT library, and

sudo apt-get install python-qt4 qt4-designer

For the designer tool.



FOR DEVELOPMENT ONLY:

The following 2 commands are necessary to convert the UI files (user interfaces) to python code:

sudo apt install pyqt4-dev-tools

and 

sudo apt install libcanberra-gtk-module libcanberra-gtk3-module

*** They will install the developer tools needed to handle the files.


To convert files tp PY extension: pyuic4 USERINTERFACENAME.ui -o OUTPUTFILENAME.py -x
